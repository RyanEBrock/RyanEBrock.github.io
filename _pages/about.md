I am an evolutionary ecologist and entomologist with research interests in behavioural ecology, population genetics/genomics, and plant-insect interactions.

Currently, I work as a Postdoctoral Researcher in the [Wells group](https://www.jic.ac.uk/people/rachel-wells/) at the John Innes Centre. My research explores plant-insect interactions between Oilseed Rape (*Brassica napus*) and the Cabbage Stem Flea Beetle (*Psylliodes chrysocephala*). Alongside this, I provide commercial services to companies interested in limiting Cabbage Stem Flea Beetle-associated impacts on crop yield.

Previously, I completed my PhD in the [Bourke group](https://andrewbourkeresearch.com) at the University of East Anglia. My PhD research focused on the behavioural ecology and population genetics of the Tree Bumblebee. Prior to this, I completed an MSc (by research) in the [Sumner group](http://www.sumnerlab.co.uk/) at the University of Bristol and and a BSc in Biological Sciences at the University of East Anglia.

Outside of work, I enjoy cycling, hiking, and birdwatching, and am an Ipswich Town FC season ticket holder.
